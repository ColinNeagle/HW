Use of financial technology to increase the organization's investment assets 

How is the company funded? The company is funded through client's investments.

## Corporate Background 
Edward Jones (**EDJ**) is an old mechanistic organization, which has finally decided to use technology to increase market share, while also improving the  attrition among their financial advisors. They have  been reluctant to do so, do to the age and social demographics of their clientele. Most of their clients are older well-establised retirees who left the work force prior to financial technology becoming commonplace and are concerned about the security of using technology for their transactions. Ironically, most of the transactions were done through faxes up until a few years ago, which is far less secure then digital transactions.

## Current Investment Financial Services Landscape
EDJ, like many older investment firms  built their core competency on fostering one-on-one interpersonal relationships to build their clientele and earn their client's trust. Their clients have relied on quarterly in-person meetings with their Financial Advisors (*FA*) to discuss investment returns, adjust the client's investment goals, and seek their FA's investment advice.

In the last 20 years, more start-up companies have entered the market and with their use of financial technology, they have taken market share from EDJ and other traditional investment firms. E-trade is a relatively new organization in the market (been around less than 40 years), but they have taken over market share with electronic trading platform to trade financial assets including common stocks, preferred stocks, futures contracts, exchange-traded funds, options, mutual funds, and fixed income investments. Ally Bank is another investment organization that is new to the market. Ally is considered in their infancy state for this industry, being in existence around 10 years, but they have excelled in the market with their all transactions on-line platform and their $0 commissions.

EDJ has been late to the financial technology party; they didn't want online platforms and etrades to undermine their core competency of in-person relationships with their clients. That changed when Frank LaQuinta was named Chief Information Officer (*CIO*) in 2018. Shortly after assuming the *CIO* position, LaQinta began working on the EDJ's Digital Acceleration Strategy.

## Digital Acceleration Strategy ##
This initiative entails:
1. Using technology to increase their number of clients.
2. Assist existing clients with more friendly EDJ software applications.
3. Digital Vault, secure digital solutions for clients, prospective clients, and Financial Advisors to share information in a more collaborative way.

 Edward Jones began using more up-to-date trading platforms than their traditional fax execution trades they been using for nearly 50 years. They also began using cloud technology to store client's data, executed trade orders, and other client and corporate sensitive information, which they wouldn't have considered even 3 or 4 years ago.

They also began using interactive tools to review prospect’s online questionnaires and quizzes; as well as, algorithms to review prospective client’s social media data in order to match them with a financial advisor who best fits their personal interests and geographic location.


## Results ##
The results of EDJ's initiative have been mixed. They have increased market share, they have also increased the number of their Financial Advisors from 17,000 to 19,000, while reducing their FA's attrition rate from 9.6% to 7.6%. They still have a lot of ground to make up with younger investors, particularly the segment with bachelor and masters degrees, who are spurring the traditional FA model altogether and using e-trade platforms exclusively.


## Recommendatons ##
Edward Jones needs to retain their client centric approach, but needs to diversify. Only 37% of US banks and investment firms have a customer service centric experience program. Their priority has instead been sales and products. Research has indicated clients of banking and investment firms are more loyal to those firms with an emphasis on customer service. To that end, EDJ, can build on their reputation of providing excellent one-on-one service to their banking clients, and should also offer other programs where clients can trade some products exclusively through technology without their FA.

EDJ should continue to invest in technology, instead of lagging behind new entrants to the industry. In 2018, it was estimated banking and investment firms invested nearly $220 billion on information technology, which is a $20 billion increase from the prior year. By investing in security measures against both human and AI fraud, digitization, and artificial intelligence, Edward Jones can better protect their customer's, while eliminating their traditional customer's fears of on online investing.
