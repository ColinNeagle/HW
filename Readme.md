## Corporate Background 
Edward Jones (**EDJ**) is an old mechanistic organization, which has finally decided to use technology to increase market share, whille also improving the  attrition among their financial advisors. They have  been reluctant to do so, do the age and social demographics of their clientele. Most of there clients are older well establsied retirees who left the work force prior to financial technology becoming commonplace and are concerned about their transactions through technology being secure. Ironically, most of the transactions were done through faxes, which are far less secure then digital transactions.

## Curent Invetment Financial Services Landscape
EDJ, like many older investment firms  built their core competency on fostering one-on-one interpersonal relationships to build their clientele and earn their client's trust. Their clients have relied on quarterly in-person meets their Financial Advisors (*FA*) to discuss their investment returns, adjust their investment goals, and seek their FA's investment advice.

In the last 20 years, more start up companies have entered the market and taken market share from EDJ and other traditional investment firms with their use of financial technology. E-trade is a relatively new entrant to the market (been around less than 40 years), but they have over-taken market share with electronic trading platform to trade financial assets including common stocks, preferred stocks, futures contracts, exchange-traded funds, options, mutual funds, and fixed income investments. Ally Bank is another investment organization that is new to the market. Ally is considered in their enfancy state for this industry, being in existence around 10 years, but they have excelled in the market with their all transactions on-line platform and their $0 commissions.

EDJ has been late to the financial technology party; they didnt want online platforms and etrades to undermine their core competency of im person relationships with their clients. that changed when Frank LaQuinta was named Chief Information Officer (*CIO*) in 2018. Shortly after assuming the *CIO* position, LaQinta began working on the EDJ's Digital Acceleration Strategy.

## Digital Acceleraton Strategy ##
These initiative entails:
1. Using technology to increse their number of clients.
2. Assist existing clients with more friendly EDJ software applications.
3. Digital Vault, secure digital solutions for clients, prospective clients, and Financial Advisors to share information in a more collaborative way.

 Edward Jones began using more up-to-date trading platforms that their fax execution trades they been using for nearly 50 years. They also began using cloud technology to store cleint's data, executed trade orders, and other client and corporate sensitive information, which they wouldnt have considered even 4 or 4 years ago.

They also began using interactive tools to review prospect’s  online questionnaires and  quizzes; as well as,  algorithms  to review prospective client’s social media data in order to match them with a financial advisor who best fits their personal situation.


## Results ##
The results of EDJ's initiative have been mixed. They have increaseed market share, they have also increased the number of Financial Advisors from 17,000 to 19,000, and reduced their FA's attrition rate from 9.6% to 7.6%. They still have a lot of ground to make up with younger investors, particularly the segement with bachelor and masters degrees, who are spuring the traditional FA model altogether and useing e trade platforms exclusively.
